# NAV tie-out

Given a generated LP statement and the period's NAV pack (via the nav MCP), independently recompute the LP's capital account and compare line by line.

> **The generated statement is the thing under test.** The NAV pack is the source of truth.

## Recompute the LP capital account

```
Beginning capital (prior statement ending)
  + Contributions (capital calls paid this period)
  − Distributions (cash + in-kind)
  + Allocated net income / (loss)
      = LP% × (realized + unrealized P&L − management fee − fund expenses)
  − Carried interest allocation (if crystallized this period)
Ending capital
```

Pull each input from the NAV pack: LP commitment %, fund-level P&L components, fee and expense totals, waterfall outputs.

## Compare

For each line on the statement, compare to your recomputed value. Tolerance: `0.01`. For each mismatch, note which input drives it (e.g., "allocated P&L differs — statement used 12.40% ownership, NAV pack shows 12.38% after the Q1 transfer").

## Additional checks

- Ending capital on this statement = beginning capital on next period's draft (if available).
- Sum of all LP ending capitals = fund NAV (within rounding).
- Commitment, unfunded, and recallable figures agree to the commitment register.

## Output

A pass/fail per line, the recomputed values alongside the statement values, and a list of flags. Do not edit the statement — the publisher acts on the flags after review.

## Hermes Profile Notes
This skill was packaged from `pi-financial-services` source path `plugins/vertical-plugins/fund-admin/skills/nav-tieout` for the Hermes financial-services profile. Use institutional data connectors first when available, cite sources, and stage outputs for qualified human review.


## Common Pitfalls
1. Do not present drafts as investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice.
2. Do not use web search as the primary source when an institutional MCP/data connector is available.
3. Do not execute transactions, contact clients, post to a ledger, or approve onboarding. Stage outputs for review.


## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Inputs, assumptions, dates, and currencies are explicit.
- [ ] Numbers tie across tables, models, decks, and memos.
- [ ] Sources are cited and institutional data is preferred where available.
- [ ] Output is labeled draft / for human review where appropriate.
