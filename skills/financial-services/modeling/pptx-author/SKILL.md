# pptx-author

Use this skill when running **headless** (managed-agent / CMA mode) and you need to deliver a PowerPoint deck as a **file artifact** rather than editing a live document via `mcp__office__powerpoint_*`.

## Output contract

- Write to `./out/<name>.pptx`. Create `./out/` if it does not exist.
- Return the relative path in your final message so the orchestration layer can collect it.

## How to build the deck

Write a short Python script and run it with Bash. Use `python-pptx`:

```python
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt

prs = Presentation("./templates/firm-template.pptx")  # if a template is provided
# or: prs = Presentation()

slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[5])    # title-only
slide.shapes.title.text = "Valuation Summary"
# ... add tables / charts / text boxes ...

prs.save("./out/pitch-<target>.pptx")
```

## Conventions (mirror the live-Office `pitch-deck` skill)

- **One idea per slide.** Title states the takeaway; body supports it.
- **Every number traces to the model.** If a figure comes from `./out/model.xlsx`, footnote the sheet and cell.
- **Use the firm template** when one is mounted at `./templates/`; otherwise default layouts.
- **Charts**: prefer embedding a PNG rendered from the model over native pptx charts when fidelity matters.
- **No external sends.** This skill writes a file; it never emails or uploads.

## When NOT to use

If `mcp__office__powerpoint_*` tools are available (Cowork plugin mode), use those instead — they drive the user's live document with review checkpoints. This skill is the file-producing fallback for headless runs.

## Hermes Profile Notes
This skill was packaged from `pi-financial-services` source path `plugins/vertical-plugins/financial-analysis/skills/pptx-author` for the Hermes financial-services profile. Use institutional data connectors first when available, cite sources, and stage outputs for qualified human review.


## Common Pitfalls
1. Do not present drafts as investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice.
2. Do not use web search as the primary source when an institutional MCP/data connector is available.
3. Do not execute transactions, contact clients, post to a ledger, or approve onboarding. Stage outputs for review.


## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Inputs, assumptions, dates, and currencies are explicit.
- [ ] Numbers tie across tables, models, decks, and memos.
- [ ] Sources are cited and institutional data is preferred where available.
- [ ] Output is labeled draft / for human review where appropriate.
